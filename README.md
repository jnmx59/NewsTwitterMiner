# NewsTwitterMiner
This is R code that I developed to assess the correlation between public interest in a particular News topic and the amount of coverage that topic recieves from major News sources. The corpus consiting of all news articles is assumed to be pre-compiled. The code takes as input an excel spreadsheet with a column for the text of each news article, with column header Text, and a column for the date that the article was published, with column header Date. The program then uses a LDA algorithm to cluster the documents by topics and extracts the top "Num_Keywords" kewords to use for a query of Twitter. After the program has the news documents clustered by topic and the associated tweets for each topic the program calculates KDE's and outputs an overlayed plot to compare how the frequency of discussion per topic is distributed for both News and Twitter.
